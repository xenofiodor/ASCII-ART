# ASCII-ART
Parsing images to ascii symbols depending on RGB sum.  
There is a choice of simple print or animation of the new generated ascii-image. 

## Tech used
- Just Java

## Installing and running
Clone the repository and run in any IDE.  
Take into account that big images may not fit in your screen.
In some IDE's animation may not work properly, so it is better to run the animation from console.
